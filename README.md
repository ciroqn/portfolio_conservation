# Amani Conservation
Portfolio website: I plan to make multiple websites using HTML, CSS and its libraries (mainly Bootstrap)  over time, but I thought I would create something conservation-based as I thought these sorts of organisations are not overly particular in *how* a website is structured/styled (unlike, say, a tech website, which make be more concerned with a minimalist, slick styling). Hence, I thought there was more 'wiggle' room in creating the styling for a website like this
## Introduction
This is a fictional website making use of CSS grid and flexbox - it has also made use of media queries to make it a responsive website, and this is, probably, above all a project to play around with media queries. This project was also to investigate how a website can be rearranged without taking too much of the overall styling away from the website as the viewport gets smaller.
